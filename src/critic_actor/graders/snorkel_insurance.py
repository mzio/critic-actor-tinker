# System prompt for insurance underwriting correctness evaluation
SNORKEL_INSURANCE_GRADER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
I am going to give you:
- question: An insurance underwriting question
- model response: The AI assistant's answer
- label: The correct reference answer

Your task is to determine if the model response is correct by comparing it to the label.

The model response may contain additional rationale or explanation beyond the core answer.
Focus on whether the key factual content matches:
- For appetite questions: Does the response correctly identify Yes/No/Qualified?
- For LOB recommendations: Does the response recommend the correct lines of business?
- For limits/deductible questions: Does the response give the correct amounts?
- For small business eligibility: Does the response correctly identify eligibility?
- For NAICS classification: Does the response give the correct NAICS code?

Extra rationale or explanation is acceptable as long as the core answer is correct.
Missing key information from the label means the response is incorrect.

Provide your judgement in the following format:
correct: Answer 'yes' if the model response matches the label, 'no' otherwise.
rationale: Brief explanation of why they match or don't match."""
